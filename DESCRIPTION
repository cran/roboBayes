Description: An implementation of Bayesian online changepoint detection (Adams and MacKay (2007) <arXiv:0710.3742>) with an option for probability based outlier detection and removal (Wendelberger et. al. (2021) <arXiv:2112.12899>). Building on the independent multivariate constant mean model implemented in the 'R' package 'ocp', this package models multivariate data as multivariate normal about a linear trend, defined by user input covariates, with an unstructured error covariance. Changepoints are identified based on a probability threshold for windows of points.
